This tutorial uses Callobject object NotificationStatus that is returned when calling ShowNotification() on NotificationManager or NotificationDisplay. 
You can add listener to StatusChangedEvent, and check CurrentStatus to learn current state of notification like Skipped, Queued, Shown, Hidden. 

Look at TutorialDemo.cs script for this in action.
